A test for a game based on javascript, because flash is dead now.
##Controls

move with WASD and kick with E
###Player 2

## Everything else
I don't care about this code you can (probably shouldn't because it's a horrifying mess) use this code however you like. All credit goes to liabru who wrote the libary and the amazing documentation that comes along.
